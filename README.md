- 👋🏻 Hello, I’m @Brandrewss as far back as I remember, I have been fascinated by computers and electronics. When I was young, my parents would throw away digital clocks and old computers. I would take them to the back yard and tear them apart to see how they worked. Fast forward a few years and like many younger guys, I was sucked into video games. My best friend and I played a lot of RuneScape and decided we were not up to par with our woodcutting levels. However, it was not something we were willing to grind out. This led to the creation of my first script. We made a woodcutting bot that chopped the wood and sold it on the Grand Exchange for us.

    Late in high school I took a STEM robotics class at my local career center and decided that I wanted to go to college to work on computer hardware. Due to a last-minute decision, I unexpectedly ended up in a software-intensive program at the University of South Carolina, Beaufort. After four years of computational science courses, I gained a significant amount of knowledge about algorithms, calculus, networks, and fundamental programming languages. During my last year of college, I was fortunate enough to be able to work with two local startups and gain fast-paced experience in real development settings.

    I have since been given the great opportunity to work with at a real estate brokerage to develop in-house software, as well as, handle integrations between their systems. I have strong attention to detail and organization.
